# Data provider adapters

**TL;DR**

Adapters contain the logic for dealing with data requests in this application.

Before the adapters there is an abstraction layer (like a "switchboard") that distributes the request to the proper data provider adapter.

Make sure you provide the `BackendProvider` in `package.json` `scripts` for the data providers you want available during build.
